    <p style="color:black;font-size:20px;font-weight: 400;">Hackathons are some of my favorite things to do. For the
      past few years, I've spent so much time attending hackathons and recently, I've also helped organized a couple of
      them. Check the many I've attended and plan on attending!</p>
